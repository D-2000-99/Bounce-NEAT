# Requirements
You will need to install the python-neat library and pygame.

# How to play
To play the original game by yourself run the bounce-game.py. Use the spacebar to jump and see how far you can go :)
```bash
python bounce-game.py
```

If you want to see neat play the game run bounce-NEAT.py.
```bash
python bounce-NEAT.py
```
# Issues:
Sometimes you will need to re-run the code for it to learn properly. If it keeps missing pipes re-running could help fix the issue.
